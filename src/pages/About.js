                <p>
                Iâ€™m LoÃ¯s. I'm an interaction designer living in Arnhem. In my spare time I have a couple of hobbies which include writing, drawing, jewelry making, traveling and cooking. I enjoy nature, being outside and learning new skills, whatever it may be. I aspire to find a job in which I can use my creativity in different ways. I also love dogs. And my cat. Of course.
