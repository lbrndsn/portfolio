                <p>I’m Loïs. I'm an interaction designer living in Arnhem. In my spare time I have a couple of hobbies
                    which
                    include playing the guitar, cooking and fitness/weightlifting. I enjoy programming and I'm working
                    on
                    getting more skilled in that area. I aspire to find a job in which I can combine interaction design
                    and
                    programming. I also love dogs. 🐕</p>
